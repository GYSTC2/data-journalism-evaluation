Relation Evaluation of Visual Elements in Data Journalism -- From the perspective of User Experience

Data journalism refers to a form of news report based on data mining and analysis, which makes data analysis results into visual charts and presents facts and narrates through visual elements. 
The use of visual elements is an important feature that distinguishes data news from traditional news. Visual elements are the direct communication medium between the producer of data journalism and the user, including graphics and text. 
Based on empirical test, I creatively proposes a usability evaluation model of visual elements of data journalism works, which plays an important role in optimizing its user experience.
This study proposes an experimental method and a theoretical model for evaluating data news elements from the perspective of user experience, and selects data journalism works awarded the GEN Data Journalism Awards as experimental materials. 
I evaluated the relationship and function of visual elements in data journalism works through user-oriented Eye-tracking (ET) experiments and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) experiments. 
This method can be widely used in the evaluation of static graphic webpage data journalism works.
