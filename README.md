	Relation Evaluation of Visual Elements in Data Journalism -- From the perspective of User Experience
## Introduction
Data journalism refers to a form of news report based on data mining and analysis, which makes data analysis results into visual charts and presents facts and narrates through visual elements.  


With the development of data journalism, some competitions related to data journalism gradually appear. The winning works often reflect the evaluation criterion of data journalism works in the current industry, and the evaluation criterion of these competitions have also become an important indicator to measure the quality of data journalism. 


However, those data journalism works are often subjectively evaluated by industry experts based on several key indicators and their personal experience, and it is unknown whether the excellent works evaluated can be favored by the audiences.


At present, academic research on data journalism mostly focuses on the historical analysis, current situation description and trend prediction of data journalism, and rarely involves the research on user experience of data journalism works. 


User experience is crucial to the communication effect of data journalism, and is the focus of data journalism industry at home and abroad. 


In view of the lack of evaluation criteria for user experience in the existing data journalism evaluation system, this research evaluates the works from the perspective of users. 


By using the user experience research methods and the eye movement experiment, we can analyze the availability of work standing from the users’ perspective and point out the problem that may exist to help improve the propagation effect of the data journalism works.
## Methods
Eye movement experiment is widely used in the communication effect research. 


The experimental results can reflect the time distribution of different parts of the whole visual threshold in the reading materials of the subjects, and the skin electrical sensor can be used as a supplement to the eye movement experiment to test the attention of the subjects in reading different parts of the content.


In the past eye movement experiments, the red-colored area in the heat map is often regarded as the content that attract readers most, which is not accurate enough. In this experiment, the skin electrical sensor was added to measure the attention degree of the subjects, which can judge the attention distribution of readers to different visual elements in the works more scientifically. 


It is of great significance for judging the usability of data journalism works and optimizing the data visualization works.

## Data Analysis
In this experiment, the data exported from the eye tracker is shown in figure below. The first column of data is the real-time time record, the third column of data is the screen content record at the moment of reading, and the rightmost columns of data are the coordinates of eye fixation points.

The Data exported from the sensor is shown in the figure below. The Data in the second column, ADC Data, can be used to represent the attention value of the subjects. The larger the number is, the more focused the user is at the moment. The sixth column is the real-time time record.

First we need to analyze the users sensor data to find out everyone‘s emotional arousal time, then combine with the eye movement experiment data to draw the content was being watched. 


Finally we need find commonness in all sample data to find out the data journalism content that is most likely to arouse readers' emotion, that is, the picture area and its content that can largely arouse readers' emotion.

# Preliminary Conclusions
1. Readers tend to spend more time reading the text than the visual section of the data.


2. Overly saturated colors and messy color schemes are not welcomed.


3. Creative graphics attract the attention of readers most.


4. The works with clear logic and no redundant words are more favorable to readers.
